# Chatbot

This repository was devoted to getting into the basics of how chatbots are created. In the repository, a simple FFN with limited capabilities was developed, together with a simple GUI app which was created as an interface for interacting with the chatbot.

Moreover, this repo contains an implementation of a Transformer network, based on Self- and Multi-head Attention, which was based on an implementation [here](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/05/transformer-chatbot-tutorial-with-tensorflow-2.html). The full implementation of the network is provided, together with rich comments describing the details of the implementation. A wonderful resource for understanding Transformers was published [here](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/), which I highly recommend.

The repo structure follows common Pythonic repository convention. Some notebooks were provided for workflow illustration, training, preprocessing, network building.
